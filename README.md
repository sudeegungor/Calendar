# Calendar

A C# program that takes the followings from the user separately:
- two dates (day, month, and year) later than 01.01.2015
- a positive number (n) and then prints each n th day between given dates without using array data structure .
The program must also print the day of the week (i.e., Monday) and the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn).
The first date can be before or after the second date.
The program should control all possible invalid user inputs and give an approriate error message.
Examples:
Inputs: day = 31
 month = ApriL
 year = 2021
Output: day is wrong
Inputs: day = -2
 month = programming
 year = 2021
Output: day is wrong
Inputs: day = 29
 month = february
 year = 2017
Output: day is wrong
